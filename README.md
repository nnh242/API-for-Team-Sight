# Team Sight - See Your Team

This project is bootstrapped from Create-React-App.

Team Sight helps you become aware of what your team members are working on by comparing the estimated and actual duration of their tasks. Actual Time < Estimates <=> Optimization. Once you enter all the tasks, data will be updated to a simple but powerful chart that allow you to see the progressive patterns and plan for optimization.
